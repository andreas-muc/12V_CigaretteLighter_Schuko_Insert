## Welcome 

3D model of an insert that allows installation of a 12V Car Cigarette Socket into a Standard Schuko socket.
I created this to install a 12V IP44 outlet at my garden hut to provide easy access to devices that are operated off a 12 Cigarette Lighter plug.

A standard IP44 Schuko socket from [Kopp](kopp.eu) P/N [10078560055](https://www.kopp.eu/produkt/schutzkontakt-steckdose-mit-klappdeckel-und-erhoehtem-beruehrungsschutz/) was used as base socket.




### Build Instructions

1. Remove the Schuko receptacle parts and internal standoff from the socket base

2. Drill a hole wide enough to take the cigarette lighter socket

3. 3D print the insert

4. Glue in the insert

5. Glue in the 12V Car Cigarette Socket

6. Bend terminal contacts (if necessary) and install cables

7. Install
